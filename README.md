Repositiory address found in <b>*Weigt et al. 2020*</b> with description in paper of the full algorithm used. <br>

Python code translated from existing IDL scripts, analysing and plotting Jupiter's X-ray aurora using Chandra HRC-I data. As well as the python scripts, the repository contains so far:
- User guide to help use the python scripts
- Scripts containing the mapping functions, custom colorbar and plot labels (credit John Coxon) used in the mapping algorithm
- Chandra_horizons2000 files added for all observations <b> up to and including 22/07/2021 </b> - can be used for the scripts.

<b>Note</b>: ".ipynb" files are Jupyter python notebooks (which can be used using Anaconda) and ".py" files are the python scripts - both are identical.

Aims to be a public platform to share code/data/etc easily.
