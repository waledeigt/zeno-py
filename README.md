Python code translated from existing IDL scripts, analysing and plotting Jupiter's X-ray aurora using Chandra HRC-I data. As well as the python scripts, the repository contains so far:
- User guide to help use the python scripts
- Scripts containing the mapping functions, custom colorbar and plot labels (credit John Coxon) used in the mapping algorithm
- Chandra_horizons2000 files added for all observations to date (as of 09/09/19) - can be used for the scripts.

<b>Note</b>: ".ipynb" files are Jupyter python notebooks (which can be used using Anaconda) and ".py" files are the python scripts - both are identical.

Aims to be a public platform to share code/data/etc easily.
